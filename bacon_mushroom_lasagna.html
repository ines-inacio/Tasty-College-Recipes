	<h3>Directions</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Fill a large pot with water, and 1 teaspoon of salt and let it boil on high heat.</li>
		<li>Cook only 2 to 3 pasta sheets at a time - to avoid them sticking to each other - for about 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Let each pasta sheet cool separately.</li>
		<li>In a separate pot, add the minced onion and garlic, 4 teaspoons of olive oil, and 1 teaspoon of salt and stir for about 3 minutes on medium heat.</li>
		<li>Add the laminated mushrooms and the bacon strips to the mix and let it cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC.</li>
		<li>Add the ground beef into the pot and season it with the black pepper, the paprika, and 1 teaspoon of salt and let it simmer, while stirring occasionally, until the beef is fully cooked.</li>
		<li>Add the lasagna 'Knorr' and the white wine to the beef and stir completely.</li>
		<li>Add 1/4 cup of water to the beef and 'Knorr' and turn the heat off.</li>
		<li>In a baking dish, gently place 4 of the lasagna sheets and pour some of the premade béchamel sauce covering each sheet.</li>
		<li>Spread the beef, mushroom and bacon mix evenly over the 4 lasagna sheets.</li>
		<li>Sprinkle some of the cheddar, gouda, and mozzarella cheese over the beef and lasagna sheets.</li>
		<li>Cover everything with another 4 lasagna sheets.</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 11 to 13 until you run out of lasagna sheets.</li>
		<li>Pour the remainder of the béchamel sauce, covering all of the lasagna.</li>
		<li>Lastly, sprinkle the lasagna with the remainder of the grated cheeses and place the baking dish in the oven for about 30 minutes or until the cheese is completely melted.</li>
		<li>Cut the lasagna and it's ready to serve!</li>
